#Nidra Visualization

This is a visulization for the song nidra written by ARUVI. IT makes use of a procedural forest with an animated fox and a bloom filter postprocessing effect.
the flowers react to the audio level fo the song. the changes in bloom values are triggered by a story board which keeps track of the number of clicks that have passed since 
the song started. These are counted with the BPM and time signature of the song.
